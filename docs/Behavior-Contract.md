# Behavior integration contract

Poise is a trigger and orchestration layer. It does not read GitHub source,
construct reviews, or mutate review threads itself.

Each behavior follows one transaction shape:

1. Gate on fresh `github-datastore` consumer state.
2. Read one immutable fact packet from `github-interface`, including head SHA
   and acting GitHub identity.
3. Persist launch intent with behavior, target, actor, source, correlation ID,
   and expected head before starting detached work.
4. Let `agent-interface` perform model work using only the permitted
   `github-interface` primitives.
5. Reconcile the durable agent outcome by exact correlation ID. Accept only
   an expected action/outcome pair on the expected head.
6. Dead-letter uncertain terminal work. Never retry an ambiguous side effect.

`review-new-issues` accepts `commented`: Caller posted every comment the
reviewer wrote, on the issue and its sub-issues, and recorded each one as it
was posted. An issue has no head, so no head is pinned or reported. A failure
is relaunched once, and only when the run recorded no comment and never began
posting. See [Review New Issues](Issue-review.md).

`review-new-prs` accepts either one atomic `requested_changes` review or the
authoritative `reviewed_clean` outcome. `approve-prs` accepts one head-pinned
approval or one atomic change request. A clean review becomes approval-eligible
on the next scheduler scan. `resolve-unblocking` uses the upstream strong
resolution primitive, which revalidates the complete gate before every thread
mutation.

New behaviors must add the required atomic fact or mutation upstream first.
They must not add GitHub authentication, GraphQL, REST, or repository-source
access to Poise.

One deliberate exception to step 4: an issue review's model work is not held
to github-interface primitives. At the operator's explicit request each
reviewer runs its provider's own CLI with full access in a fresh checkout, so
it can read the whole repository and run the tests. Its GitHub side effect is
still Caller's: the reviewer writes comments to a file, and Caller posts them
through github-interface as the review agent, only on the issue and its
sub-issues.
